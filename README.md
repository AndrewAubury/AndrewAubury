# About Andrew :smile:

Hi there! My name is Andrew and I am a 23-year-old software programmer from Luton, England. I specialize in PHP and Java, but I also have experience with C#.

I am passionate about open source projects and I enjoy contributing to them in my spare time. In the past, I have worked on a variety of projects, including a PHP web application and a Java command-line tool.

In my professional life, I currently work as a SOC engineer at Cloudflare. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a programmer. I believe that collaboration and sharing knowledge are key to success in the tech industry, and I try to embody these values in my work :nerd_face:

Here are a few nerdy jokes to add some fun to the readme:

- Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't know how to 'null' his feelings.
- Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25.
- Why do programmers hate nature? It has too many bugs.
- Why do programmers always prefer dark mode? It's easier on their eyes.
- Why do programmers always have to break things to make them better? Because it's in their 'debug' nature.

Thanks for reading! :thumbsup:
